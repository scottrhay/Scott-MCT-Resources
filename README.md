## Learning Tips from Experience

After 25+ years in tech and countless hours in the classroom, here's what I've learned helps students succeed:

- **Start with the business problem** - Don't get caught up in features. Focus on what you're trying to solve.
- **Practice immediately** - Use the labs, but also try building something for your own work.
- **Ask questions** - I'm here to help, and chances are others have the same question.
- **Connect the dots** - Look for ways these tools work together. That's where the real magic happens.

## Questions or Need Help?

Don't hesitate to reach out during our sessions or drop me a line afterward. I want to see you succeed, and sometimes a quick conversation can clear up what hours of reading couldn't.

Let's build something great together!
