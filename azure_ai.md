## My Teaching Approach

Having worked with AI at Microsoft and Amazon, I focus on practical applications that solve real business problems. In my classes, we'll:

- **Start with business scenarios** before diving into technical details
- **Build working solutions** you can adapt for your own projects  
- **Focus on prompt engineering** and getting AI to work reliably
- **Cover the gotchas** I've learned from implementing AI in production

The goal isn't just passing exams - it's building AI solutions that actually help your business save time and money.

## Questions or Need Help?

Each of these courses builds on the others, but you don't have to take them in order. During our sessions, we'll figure out the best path based on your background and goals.
